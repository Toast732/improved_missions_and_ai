	Tracks the speeds of vehicles, used to integrate the speed tracker into the vehicle system

	Able to support a set amount of resolutions, or a specified one.

	Code isn't the cleanest and is a bit confusing, as trying get good type and variable names is difficult due to the amount of optimisations being done for this.

	Classes


]]

---@alias VehicleSpeedTrackerID integer the id of the speed tracker. Used to index the table of the speed data.

---@class VehicleSpeedTrackerData
---@field vehicle_id integer the id of the vehicle it is tracking the speed of
---@field tracker_id VehicleSpeedTrackerID the id of the speed tracker.
---@field update_rate VehicleSpeedTrackerUpdateRateResolution the update rate of this speed tracker.
---@field smoothing_amount integer the number of entries back it will store and average from for outputting the speed.
---@field speed number the speed of the vehicle in m/s.
---@field speed_history table<integer, number> the raw calculated speed history.
---@field last_vector Vector3 the previous position of the vehicle.
---@field last_updated_tick integer the last tick the speed was updated.

---@alias VehicleSpeedTrackerTickerData table<integer, VehicleSpeedTrackerID> indexed by their tick id, stores the tracker id for the vehicle.

---@alias VehicleSpeedTrackerTickers table<VEHICLE_SPEED_TRACKER_UPDATE_RATE, VehicleSpeedTrackerTickerData> indexed by the ticker update rate, stores the ticker data.
